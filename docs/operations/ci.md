# CI and shipping

Work reaches `main` through pull requests against thirteen repositories, and one GitHub Actions workflow in
`back` decides whether any of them is shippable: it fetches the private modules, builds and tests everything,
starts the stack and runs the smoke test against it. This page is that workflow, the token it needs, and the
order the merges have to happen in.

<figcaption>The upper lane is the merge order and the token, not a workflow. A library repository is merged
before the service that depends on it, and the commit in `back` that points at both is merged last — which is
what step 3 shows CI doing: reading the pointers. Step 4 is the one credential the workflow needs, a
fine-grained token with `Contents: read` on the thirteen module repositories. The lower lane is the workflow
in order: checkout without credentials, fetch the modules, build and test, write a fresh `.env`, start the
stack, run the smoke test.</figcaption>

</div>

1. **A library repository is merged first.** It holds the `XController` Feign interface and the `In`/`Out`
   records that both the service and its callers compile against.
2. **Then the service repository**, which depends on that library at `${project.version}`.
3. **Then the commit in `back`** that moves the submodule pointers. CI's `git submodule update` reads exactly
   those SHAs, so a pointer merged before its target exists makes a fresh clone unbuildable.
4. **`CARMONAI_TOKEN` is the read credential** for the thirteen private module repositories —
   `Contents: read-only`, on the module repos and not on `back`.
5. **`actions/checkout@v7` with `persist-credentials: false`** clones `back` with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
   which cannot read the siblings; the fetch step then checks access module by module before initialising.
6. **`mvn -B verify`** on Temurin 25 builds all thirteen modules in dependency order and runs the unit tests
   and the Testcontainers integration tests.
7. **A generated `.env`, `docker compose up -d --build --wait` and `bash smoke.sh`** — the same three commands
   this page's sibling tells a person to run, on the CPU engine, with fresh secrets.

## What it is

One workflow, `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`, triggered on every pull request and on every push to `main`. It runs
on `ubuntu-latest` (Docker is preinstalled and Testcontainers needs a Linux runner), has a 30-minute timeout,
and declares `permissions: contents: read` — the workflow itself only ever reads. The comment at the top states
its purpose in terms of what it catches: *a broken migration, a Resource/Feign mismatch or a security
regression in the smoke test fails it.* Those are the three failure modes that are invisible in a code review
and obvious in a running stack.

## Fetching the modules needs a token

`back` holds thirteen git submodules under `api/`, one Git repository per module. They are private, and
`GITHUB_TOKEN` — the token Actions issues automatically — is scoped to the repository the workflow runs in. It
cannot read a sibling, so `git submodule update --init --recursive` would fail on the first module.
`CARMONAI_TOKEN` is a fine-grained personal access token with `Contents: read-only`, granted on the module
repositories and not on `back`; read-only is the whole permission set.

The step does the access check before it does the clone: it walks every `url` in `.gitmodules`, asks the API for
each repository, and exits with a `::error::` annotation naming the repository if the answer is not 200.

```bash
for repo in $(git config -f .gitmodules --get-regexp '\.url$' | sed -E 's#.*github\.com/(.*)\.git$#\1#'); do
  code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://api.github.com/repos/$repo")
  [ "$code" = 200 ] || { echo "::error::CARMONAI_TOKEN cannot read $repo (HTTP $code)"; exit 1; }
done
```

A module added to `back` but not to the token's repository list fails here, in about a second, instead of
minutes later inside a Maven resolution error that says nothing about permissions. That is not hypothetical:
adding a module is a documented step in the `carmonai-new-service` skill precisely because the token has to be
updated by hand. The clone rewrites the URL rather than passing credentials per command —
`git config --global url."https://x-access-token:${TOKEN}@github.com/carmonai/".insteadOf
"https://github.com/carmonai/"`, then `git submodule update --init --recursive`, then
`git config --global --remove-section` on the same key — because `git -c` settings do not reliably reach the
`git submodule` child processes. Removing it immediately keeps the token out of any later `git config --list`.

## Build, test, and start the stack

`actions/setup-java@v6` installs Temurin **25** with `cache: maven`, then `mvn -B verify` runs. Temurin 25 is
the LTS the project targets and the same JDK the runtime images use; `verify` builds the thirteen modules in
the order the aggregator's `pom.xml` declares, runs the unit tests on branchy logic, and runs one Testcontainers
integration test per database service against a pinned Postgres image. There is no `mvn install` and no package
registry — each service resolves its library from the reactor in the same run.

The workflow then runs `docker compose up -d --build --wait` and `bash smoke.sh`, both with
`working-directory: docker`. `--wait` is what makes the next step meaningful: `smoke.sh` immediately issues real
requests through `localhost:8080`. CI runs the CPU engine — GitHub's runners have no GPU — so `smoke.sh` uses
its defaults, `MODEL=carmonai/qwen3-0.6b ENGINE=llama`. A *Service logs* step then runs only on
`failure() && steps.stack.outcome != 'skipped'`, and a *Stop the stack* step runs `docker compose down -v` on
`always()` under the same condition.

## A generated environment file, every run

Before the stack starts, the workflow writes `docker/.env` with seven freshly generated secrets — `DB_NAME`,
`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `VALKEY_PASSWORD`, `ENGINE_API_KEY`, `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` (from
`openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 | grep -v -- ----- | tr -d '\r\n'`) and
`GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. They exist for one run on an ephemeral runner and are never stored.

**The seventh key was missing until it was noticed here, and CI would have failed without it.**
`docker/compose.yaml` gained the observability stack after this workflow was last touched, and its `grafana`
service reads `${GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD:?set in .env}`. With only six keys written, `docker compose up` stops
at variable interpolation — *"GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD: set in .env"* — before a single container starts. The
repair is the one line that is now in the workflow, matching `docker/.env.example`. This is worth remembering
as a failure mode rather than a fixed bug: **adding a service that requires a new variable silently breaks
every environment that generates its own `.env`**, and the compose assertion (`:?`) is what turns that into an
immediate, readable failure instead of a service that starts with an empty password.

`VLLM_API_KEY` is deliberately *not* generated: only `compose.gpu.yaml` reads it, and CI does not use that
overlay.

## Starting the stack and running the smoke test

The workflow then runs `docker compose up -d --build --wait` and `bash smoke.sh`, both with
`working-directory: docker`. `--wait` is what makes the next step meaningful: `smoke.sh` immediately issues
real requests through `localhost:8080`. CI runs the CPU engine — GitHub's runners have no GPU — so `smoke.sh`
uses its defaults, `MODEL=carmonai/qwen3-0.6b ENGINE=llama`. A *Service logs* step then runs only on
`failure() && steps.stack.outcome != 'skipped'`, and a *Stop the stack* step runs `docker compose down -v` on
`always()` under the same condition, so the volumes go with it.

## The merge order

Ordering across repositories is the one thing a green workflow cannot prove: each repository's CI passes on
its own branch while the combination is still broken.

1. **The library repository** (`api/account`, `api/auth`, `api/organization`, `api/usage`, `api/billing`) — it
   is what the service compiles against.
2. **The service repository** (`api/account-service`, and so on) — it depends on the library at
   `${project.version}`.
3. **`back`'s pointer commit** — the submodule gitlinks. Nothing else in `back` changes when a module changes;
   the whole repository is an aggregator `pom.xml`, `docker/`, `.github/` and thirteen pointers.

The reason is mechanical. `git submodule update` checks out the exact commit a pointer names, and Maven
resolves `ai.carmonai:account:1.0.0` from the reactor. A `back` pointer naming a service commit whose library
commit is not merged yet gives a fresh clone that cannot build, even though every repository is green on its
own — and the failure appears in CI, not in the PR that caused it. The user's rule sits on top: never push to
`main`, open a pull request, and merge only when the user says merge.

## The docs workflow

`.github/workflows/docs.yaml` publishes this site, separately and independently of the code workflow. It
triggers on a push to `main` touching `docs/**`, `mkdocs.yml`, `requirements.txt` or the workflow itself, and
on `workflow_dispatch` so the site can be rebuilt from the Actions tab without an empty commit. Its
`concurrency` group is `docs` with `cancel-in-progress: false` — cancelling a `gh-deploy` halfway leaves a
half-pushed `gh-pages` branch, which is a broken site rather than a slow one.

The job checks out with `fetch-depth: 0`, installs Python 3.12 and `requirements.txt`, runs
`mkdocs build --strict`, and publishes with `mkdocs gh-deploy --force`. `fetch-depth: 0` is not optional: the
`git-revision-date-localized` plugin dates every page from its last commit, and a shallow clone has no history
to read. `--strict` turns a broken internal link, an unknown anchor or a missing nav page into a failure, so a
page cannot silently disappear from the published site.

Two repository settings are needed and neither is in the file, which the workflow's own header says:
**Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions** must be *Read and write*, or the push to `gh-pages` is
refused, and **Settings → Pages → Source** must be *Deploy from a branch*, branch `gh-pages`, folder `/`.

## Why it is like this

**One workflow, not one per module.** Thirteen repositories with thirteen workflows would be thirteen places to
keep a Java version in step. The integration test is what actually needs to run, and only `back` can run it —
it is the only repository that sees all thirteen modules at once.

**The full stack, on every pull request.** Starting fourteen containers and running 443 lines of smoke test
takes minutes, and it is the only check that catches a broken migration, a route predicate that no longer
matches its path, or a filter that stopped stripping a header.

**Fresh secrets rather than repository secrets, and `persist-credentials: false`.** Nothing pins CI to a
credential that has to be rotated, no run inherits another run's state, and the one long-lived secret is a read
token that cannot write anything.

## What would change it

- **Any new service that requires a variable.** The `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` omission above is the worked
  example: the workflow generates its own `.env`, so a variable added to `compose.yaml` and not to that block
  breaks the stack step for everyone. A check that compares the variables compose interpolates against the
  ones the workflow writes would catch it at the source.
- **A published library.** Services resolve their library from the reactor, which is why the merge order is
  strict. A package registry would make a pointer commit independently buildable, at the cost of a publishing
  step — the plan rejected GitHub Packages because cross-repo reads need a classic token.
- **GPU coverage in CI.** GitHub's runners have no GPU, so `bench.sh` and `batch-bench.sh` are not run there.
- **A second person.** `CARMONAI_TOKEN` is one person's fine-grained token; a GitHub App installation token
  would not expire with their account.

## Where to look

- [ci.yaml](https://github.com/carmonai/back/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yaml) — the whole workflow, 80
  lines, including the generated `.env` this page flags.
- [docs.yaml](https://github.com/carmonai/back/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yaml) — the site build and
  the two repository settings it needs.
- [pom.xml](https://github.com/carmonai/back/blob/main/pom.xml) — the thirteen modules in dependency order,
  which is the merge order written down.
- [.gitmodules](https://github.com/carmonai/back/blob/main/.gitmodules) — the repositories the token has to
  be able to read.
- [smoke.sh](https://github.com/carmonai/back/blob/main/docker/smoke.sh) — what the workflow is actually
  asserting, in 443 lines.
