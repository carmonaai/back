# Phase 7 progress (production), part a: what needs no outside decision

Working log started 2026-10-03. Plan: [inference-plan.md](inference-plan.md) §9 (LGPD: deletion on termination, access log, rights), §11 row 7. The user chose (2026-10-03) to start phase 7 with the local work: erasure across services and export, access log, then console sign-in flows. Hosting, Kubernetes, payments (Pix, NFS-e) and the legal checklist wait for the user's decisions. Rules: `phase-7` branches only; commit and push when green; PRs at the end; never merge without the user's go-ahead.

## Checklist

- [x] Branches `phase-7`: back, batch-service, account, account-service, gateway-service, inference-service
- [x] batch-service erases a closed organization's batch data: files deleted, running batches stopped, no output written (sweep via the `organization` library); IT
- [x] Data export: `GET /accounts/{id}/export` (account + its organizations and roles), routed by the gateway; IT
- [x] Gateway access log (Marco Civil art. 15): one JSON line per request in its own file, 6-month rolling retention, ids only; gateway sets `X-Request-Id` and inference-service keeps it
- [x] smoke: closing an org erases its batch files; export; access log written and free of secrets
- [x] `mvn clean verify` + CPU smoke green; logs clean
- [x] Docs: plan progress/deviations, skills, templates
- [x] Commit + push, PRs
- [x] Merged (part a)

### Part b: console sessions and email flows (branches `phase-7b`: back, auth, auth-service, account, account-service, gateway-service)

- [x] auth-service sessions: login sets the refresh cookie; `POST /auth/refresh` rotates it; reuse kills the session; `POST /auth/logout`; internal `DELETE /auth/sessions/accounts/{id}`; IT
- [x] gateway: routes and permitAll for refresh/logout and the public account endpoints; only the refresh cookie reaches auth-service, only on refresh/logout; `Origin` check on POST login/register/refresh/logout
- [x] account-service email flows: verification on register (login waits for it), password reset (also verifies, logs out everywhere), register answers the same for a known email (an email goes to the owner instead); Mailpit in compose; IT
- [x] erasure deletes the account's sessions
- [x] smoke + bench scripts verify their accounts through Mailpit; smoke covers refresh, reuse, logout, Origin, reset, enumeration
- [x] `mvn clean verify` + CPU smoke green; logs clean; docs; commit + push, PRs

## Design decisions, part b

- **Session** (auth-service, plan §4): `session(id, account_id, token_hash SHA-256, created_at, last_used_at, expires_at)`. Login creates one and sets `__Host-carmona-rt={id}.{secret}` (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict, Path=/, 30 days); the access token (JWT) stays in the body. Refresh: unknown id → 401; known id with the wrong secret = a stolen, already-rotated cookie → the session is deleted, 401; past 30 days or 7 days idle → deleted, 401; else a conditional rotate (`WHERE token_hash = old`; 0 rows = a concurrent refresh → 401, session kept) and a new access token. Logout deletes the session and expires the cookie.
- **Cookies at the gateway**: `Cookie` stays stripped on every route except `POST /auth/refresh` and `/auth/logout`, which get only the refresh cookie. `Origin`, when present, must be a configured console origin on `POST /auth/login|register|refresh|logout` (403 otherwise); absent = not a browser, no CSRF risk.
- **Email** (account-service, `spring-boot-starter-mail`, SMTP from env; Mailpit in compose): tokens of 256 random bits, stored as SHA-256 in `account_token(token_hash, account_id, purpose, expires_at)`, single use. Verification: 24 h, sent on register; login answers 403 `email_not_verified` until then (the password was right, so nothing leaks). Reset: 1 h; `POST /accounts/password-reset {email}` always 202; confirming sets the password, marks the email verified (it proved ownership), deletes every session. Registering a known email answers the same 202 and mails the owner instead (a squatter's unverified account is taken back through a reset). A send that fails rolls the request back (503).
- **Erasure** order: memberships, sessions (auth-service, through the `auth` library), then the account (its tokens cascade).

## Notes, part b

- Tests: auth-service IT 6 (+3: rotation, reuse ends the session for both copies, logout, all sessions of an account, register 202 for new and known, login 403/401); account-service IT 8 (+2, 2 changed; real Mailpit container: login 403 until verified, a link works once, reset sets the password, verifies the email and ends sessions, a squatter's unverified account is taken back by a reset, known email → 202 + email, erasure ends sessions); gateway `OriginFilterTest` and `IdentityHeadersFilterTest` (only the refresh cookie, only on refresh/logout; client identity headers dropped).
- Smoke (CPU) reads every link from Mailpit: register 202 → login 403 → verify → login with the cookie; known email 202 + "already" email; refresh rotates; the first cookie again → 401 and the rotated one too; foreign Origin 403; logout; reset (unknown email 202, link, old password 401, the session gone, new password 200); erasure ends the last session. No emails, tokens or cookies in any service log.
- `MockServerHttpRequest` doesn't parse a `Cookie` header into `getCookies()` (Netty does): the gateway reads the header itself, so tests and production behave alike.
- Feign has no `@CookieValue`: the refresh and logout endpoints take the `Cookie` header in the shared interface.
- Smoke pitfall under `set -o pipefail`: `producer | grep -q` (or `| head -1`) stops reading early, the producer (`docker compose exec`) dies on a broken pipe and the pipeline fails though grep matched. Capture first (`all=$(…)`), then grep the variable; take the first match with `sed -n '1…p'`.
- The 202 for every registration means a typo'd email gets no feedback beyond "check your inbox"; the console will say so.
- Not done (yet): invitations (organization membership by email), a per-email throttle on reset requests (the per-IP limiter caps them meanwhile), SMTP credentials for a real provider (the hosting decision).

## Design decisions (keep consistent when resuming)

- **Erasure on close is pulled, not pushed.** batch-service sweeps (`carmona.batch.erase-every`, 1 min) the organizations it holds data for (files, running batches), asks organization-service for each one's status through the existing `organization` library (`tenant`), and erases those `closed` (only an explicit `closed`: an unknown id or an unreachable organization-service never erases, so a misrouted URL answering 404 can't wipe everyone's data): deletes their files, marks their running batches `cancelling` with `erase = true`. The finisher ends an erased batch without writing output or error files and deletes its lines. A push (organization-service calling batch-service) would need a `batch` library repo and an event saga; the sweep needs neither, heals itself after any failure, and bounds the delay at one sweep. ponytail: one status call per organization with data per sweep; an `organization.closed` event when that count grows.
- **Keys of a closed organization** are not revoked one by one: the gateway refuses keys of an organization that isn't active, within its 60 s cache. Keys hold no personal data.
- **Keys can now expire and be rotated** (2026-10-05, `V2026.10.05.001__api_key_expiry.sql`; see [inference-plan.md](inference-plan.md) §4, §12): `expires_at` null = never, so nothing issued earlier changed; the lookup treats an expired key like a revoked one (both 404 → the gateway's 401 `invalid_api_key`); expired keys free their slot in the 50-key cap; `POST …/api-keys/{id}/rotate` revokes and reissues in one transaction, keeping the old key's expiry. Still to do in this area: `last_used_at` (backlog), and the two gateway changes in §12 (the `/rotate` route segment, and refusing a cached principal whose `expiresAt` has passed).
- **Ledger and usage stay** after closing (ids only; the ledger is kept for tax).
- **Export** (LGPD art. 18): the account's own data (id, name, email, created) and its organizations (id, name, status, tier, role). Usage and billing belong to organizations and carry no personal data. Same caller rule as `GET /accounts/{id}`: yourself only.
- **Access log**: a gateway `WebFilter` at the highest precedence (outside the security chain, so refused requests count too; `/actuator/**` probes skipped) writes one line per request on logger `access` (method, path without query, status, duration, client IP, account or organization + key ids, request id) to `/var/log/carmona/access.log` through `logback-spring.xml`: daily files, `maxHistory` 184 (≈ 6 months), never on stdout. Restricted by being only in the gateway's volume; production ships it to a store with access control. Never headers, bodies or query strings.
- **Request id**: the gateway overwrites any client `X-Request-Id` with its own UUID on every route; inference-service uses it (instead of minting one) for the answer and the usage event, so the access log, the client's support handle and usage line up. Calls that don't come through the gateway (batch-service) still get one minted by inference-service.

## Notes

- Tests: batch-service IT 7 (+1: a closed organization's files go, its held batch ends cancelled without files and without lines; an active and an unknown organization keep theirs); account-service IT 6 (+1: export, 403 for someone else); inference-service IT 17 (+1: the gateway's request id is the answer's and the usage event's); gateway `AccessLogFilterTest` (client request id replaced, one response header even when a service echoes it, ids logged, no secrets or query string).
- Smoke (CPU): request id from the gateway to the usage event; access log line with organization and key, absent from stdout; access log included in the canary/secret/query-string leak check; export (owner 200, stranger 403); closing the organization erases its batch files within the 5 s sweep.
- Spring Security's principal isn't visible to a `WebFilter` outside its chain (it decorates the exchange further in): the access log reads the caller's ids from exchange attributes that `IdentityHeadersFilter` sets; attributes are shared by every decorated exchange.
- Spring Cloud Gateway appends the routed response's headers: an `X-Request-Id` set early came back twice (ours + inference-service's copy). Set it in `beforeCommit` instead.
- `docker compose up --build <svc>` also recreates the dependencies it rebuilt: billing's debit failed for ~50 s while usage-service was recreated (breaker open 30 s), then recovered. Not a bug; BillingJobs only logs the exception class, which hid the cause for a minute.
- The erasure sweep warned every 5 s about two synthetic organizations from the phase-6 kill experiments (unknown to organization-service, 404): unknown is now a debug line; their files expire with the 30 days.
