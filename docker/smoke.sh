# End-to-end check through the gateway. Run after the stack is up WITH the object-storage overlay, because the batch section
# needs it: docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.minio.yaml up -d --build --wait
# (add -f compose.gpu.yaml for ENGINE=vllm). The environment or .env must hold every name of .env.example: the usual ones plus
# GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD and the MINIO_* / STORAGE_* names, which compose refuses to start without.
# The simulator image is a local build: run `bash docker/sim/build.sh` once before the first `up`, or compose stops (image not found).
# It ends by draining this IP's login bucket (refills 1/s): wait ~20 s before running it again.
# It starts by waiting, at most 60 s, until the console login route answers something other than 503: right after `up --wait`
# the gateway has answered 503 there once in four runs, before any assertion. The wait costs one login attempt of this IP's bucket.
# It stops and restarts valkey once (API-key lookups must fail closed with 503), runs chats on the engine
# (the simulator by default, vLLM with ENGINE=vllm), and greps every log and a database dump for a canary string.
# Run it against another compose project with COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=... (compose reads it; the stack must run under it).
# Continue-on-fail: a failed assertion is counted (note_fail) and the run goes on, so one run lists every failure; the
# exit status is the number of failures (capped at 1). Later assertions that depend on a failed one can fail as a
# consequence; read the first FAIL of each chain.
# The simulator is the patched one (docker/sim/build.sh builds the image compose.yaml uses): it notices a client that hangs
# up (G1 of work/prototype-sim/FINDINGS-contract.md) and reports usage on every chunk (G3), so the engine-idle-after-a-
# hang-up and cancelled-stream-billed assertions run on it as on vLLM. Against upstream's own simulator image
# (ENGINE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-inference-sim:v0.11.4@sha256:d60f0fb0... when the stack was started) run with SIM_STOCK=1:
# the two are then printed as `skip-sim` with their reason and counted, and without it they fail, which is how this script
